# pyFunctionEngine
A python library for generating Latex formatted math functions directly from maths in Python.

This library is designed to streamline the process of completing technical calculations and publishing them in a manner which can then be reviewed and presented to others. It enables the user to do maths directly in Python and then have the underlying equation printed to a neat and presentable Latex math format.

The library is unit aware through use of the _pint_ python library.

Current functionality is limited to basic arithmetic operators and trignometry but more functions will be added as time allows and needs require.
